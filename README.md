# Israel-Palestine_Fatalities_complete_EDA
This EDA project is designed to provide valuable insights into the dynamics of fatalities, with the ultimate goal of contributing to a better understanding of the conflicts and the human toll they have taken.
Some of the tasks are:
Analyze Fatality Trends: Explore the dataset and track the trends in fatalities over time. Identify any significant changes, spikes, or declines in the number of fatalities. 
Demographic Analysis: Conduct a demographic analysis by examining the age, gender, and citizenship of the individuals killed. Determine if there are any notable patterns or disparities in the data. 
Geospatial Analysis: Utilize the event location, district, and region information to perform geospatial analysis. Visualize the distribution of fatalities on a map and identify areas that have experienced higher levels of violence.
Hostilities Participation Analysis: Investigate the extent of individuals' participation in hostilities before their deaths. Analyze the relationship between participation and the circumstances surrounding each fatality.
Injury Analysis: Examine the types of injuries inflicted on individuals. Identify the most common types of injuries and assess their severity.
Weapons Used: Analyze the ammunition and means by which the individuals were killed. Determine the most frequently used weapons or methods and evaluate their impact.
Victim Profiles: Create profiles of the victims based on the available data such as age, gender, citizenship, and place of residence. Identify common characteristics among the victims.
